title: Cell development kit - kinetic analysis toolkit
abstract: |
  A shared understanding of how to interpret data from CFE systems would speed the development of measurements and standards towards improved reproducibility and address challenges in interpreting and comparing existing and future data, including data from failed experiments ([NIST, 2024](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1500-26)). Time-course measurements of the product expressed in the cytosol are favored over endpoint measurements, despite the time, labor, and costs involved, to obtain a more complete and informative view of a cytosol. This package helps to standardize the reporting of measurements as a reduced quantity, such as a mean value, with uncertainty and include a baseline from negative control measurements. The collection of such data enable reaction optimization and the development of predictive modeling tools.

## Overview of the package

- platemap template - _forthcoming_
- analysis functions
- graphing functions 

## Experimental setup

In order to make the most of this toolkit it is necessary to ensure that your has been designed following best practices to include replicates and controls. When designing an experiment we recommend following our platemap guide. Additionally, the following code makes some assumptions regarding the format of the incoming data. If you are using a Cytation instrument see our Getting started guide. Otherwise, it might be necessary to write some glue code to transform your raw data into a format compatible with this library. 

As an example, we will consider a platemap that contains information about two separate experiments: "Concentration" and "Artifact". These experiments test either the concentration or identity of template DNA in 10 uL PURE reactions. 

In "Concentration", we investigate the expression of a fluorescent reporter protein as the amount of tempalte DNA is increased from 0 to 100 $\frac{ng}{\mu L}$. This experiment was arrayed on row B of a 96 well plate. 

In "Artifact", we were trouble shooting some DNA templates from our inventory that were giving us problematic results. The concentrations for each construct were used "as is" since we we're trying to find which tempalte (if any) was resulting in non-expression in PURE reactions.

## Load data

After collecting appropriately formatted data, we can load the fluorescent timeseries data and experimental platemap into the cell-development kit. They should be formatted as .txt and .csv files, respectively. The `data` output will be used in subsequent plotting functions.

## Inspect data

### Visualize timeseries data

Use `plot_plate()` to look at plots of plate reader data, laid out the same as the plate. This provides you with a simple way to get a quick over view of your data across the entire well plate (see [Interactive Notebook](../01_modify_template/supplementary.ipynb)).

The figure below allows you to explore the plate by Experiment and save figures to your local machine.

### Calculate and plot steady state 

Use `find_steady_state()` to obtain a table the time and intensity of steady state fluorescence.

Plot steady state fluorescence is based on our steady state definition. There are three potential ways to calculate steady state:
1. Steady state determined by the point of minimum change (i.e., where velocity is closest to zero). This is what we do by default.
2. Steady state determined by the maximum fluorescence value. This is the simplest to explain and understand.
3. Steady state as calculated by the intercept of the $V_{max}$ line with the maximum data value. This tends to match our intuition about where the steady state is the least, but has pleasing symmetry with the way we calculate the lag time (intercept of $V_{max}$ with zero).

### Kinetic analysis

Use `kinetic_analysis()` to obtain a table with calculate kinetic parameters. The following parameters are calculated:

- $t_{max}$ Time to reach the maximum yield of product expressed, as the time from the start of the measurement to the time to reach the maximum yield;
- $ v_{max}$ Maximum rate of product expression, as the maximum linear rate of production;
- $t_{lag}$, as the time from the start of the measurement to the time to reach the maximum rate of expression;

See ([NIST, 2024](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1500-26)) for a more thorough explanation.

:class: warning

If kinetics can't be solved for a given well, a warning will be printed and that well will have "Not a Number" (NaN) or "Not a Time" (NaT) for the relevant parameters.

## Export data

To share your data we have provided some functions which export the dataframes underlying the generated plots with a consistent experimental ID. We also recommend sharing high quality datasets on a repository (we like Zenodo). Archiving experimental data is/will be a key part of sharing knowledge within the Nucleus Community. See our [Open Science Guidelines](https://devnotes.bnext.bio/open-science) for more information.
